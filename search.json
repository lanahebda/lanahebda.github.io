    "text": "Many would say that America was founded on football because let’s face it, everyone loves a good Friday Night lights back in their hometown, some Sunday night football and there is nowhere else a college kid would rather be than in a stadium on a Saturday.\nBut if you look back on America’s pastime, it’s really baseball that has played an active role in the shaping of America. Plus it was also founded about 50 years before football began to make its appearance.\nWhether it’s baseball, football, basketball, soccer, or any other sport a person finds themselves watching, it’s that one underlying theme that we all have in common.\nWe all like to watch them and we all have our favorite teams. Well almost all of us.\nI have loved to watch the game of baseball since I was younger, but just never developed a favorite team to follow. I know it sounds crazy to be able to sit down, watch a game, and not really root for anyone. So, I decided to let the data do the talking, find the things that makes baseball exciting, let go of being indecisive, and find a team to be consistent with for a year. Who knows, maybe it’ll turn into something more.\nSo what makes baseball exciting?\nI know there are a number of things, but I decided to focus on pitching, hitting, and fielding.\nThe more strikeouts a team has, obviously the more of a chance they’re going to have at winning. Taking that philosophy and running with it, there are four teams that fit the narrative to follow: Atlanta Braves, Tampa Bay Rays, Houston Astros, and the Philadelphia Phillies.\nWhy even consider a team that is way below average when it comes to strikeouts? It’ll make sense here in a minute.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\npitching &lt;- read_csv(\"pitching.csv\") \n\n\nnewpitching &lt;- pitching |&gt; \n  filter(SO9 &gt;= 9 & W &gt;= 90) \n\nrangespitch &lt;- pitching |&gt; filter(Tm == \"Texas Rangers\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=pitching, aes(x=W, y=SO9), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=newpitching, aes(x=W, y=SO9), colour=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=rangespitch, aes(x=W, y=SO9), colour=\"blue\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 9) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 90) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=newpitching, aes(x=W, y=SO9, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=rangespitch, aes(x=W, y=SO9, label=Tm)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Games Won\", \n    y=\"Strike Outs per 9 Innings\", \n    title=\"High Strike Outs, High Wins: Part of the Winning Formula in Baseball\", \n    subtitle=\"Atlanta Braves have the best of both worlds with dominating on the mound and winning games.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By: Lana Hebda\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nHomeruns, triples, and doubles, some of the most exciting hits to watch in a game that makes a day at the ballpark more fun. Going from pitching to hitting, all the signs are pointing that the Atlanta Braves will be the team for 2024, but the Rangers are basically right there with them in the box.\nWould it be dumb to even consider rooting for them? I mean they did win the World Series last year so why not hop on the bandwagon?\n\n\nCode\nbatting &lt;- read_csv(\"batting.csv\")\n\nhits &lt;- batting |&gt; \n  select(`Tm`, `2B`, `3B`, `HR`)\n\nTeamBatting &lt;- hits |&gt; \n    pivot_longer(\n    cols=-Tm, \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Percentage\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=TeamBatting, aes(x=reorder(Tm, Percentage), weight=Percentage, fill=Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#414c66\", \"#617398\", \"#92ace5\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"&lt;span style = 'color:#414c66;'&gt;Home Runs&lt;/span&gt; versus &lt;span style = 'color:#617398;'&gt;Triples&lt;/span&gt; versus &lt;span style = 'color:#92ace5;'&gt;Doubles&lt;/span&gt;\", \n    title=\"The Most Exciting Hits to Watch\", \n    subtitle=\"The Three Powerhouses: Doubles, Triples, and Home Runs make for a more entertaining day at the ballpark.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By: Lana Hebda\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.title.x = element_textbox_simple(halign = .5)\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nExciting plays and plays that will make a person want to gouge their eyes out sometimes. I mean sure they have their good games, but could you imagine watching a Giants game? 117 errors in a season. At least they made 30 more double plays than the Yankees.\nAll jokes aside, the Rangers only made 57 errors in their season and had 143 double plays. I mean if watching some exciting baseball is on the checklist, the Rangers are the guys to watch. While the Braves are lower on the list, their numbers still aren’t the worst with 82 errors and 134 double plays.\n\n\nCode\nfielding &lt;- read_csv(\"field.csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=fielding, \n    aes(y=reorder(Tm, DP), x=E, xend=DP),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"darkgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"darkgreen\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"&lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;Errors&lt;/span&gt; versus &lt;span style = 'color:darkgreen;'&gt;Double Plays&lt;/span&gt;\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"Errors and Double Plays: The fine line between failure and success\", \n    subtitle=\"The Giants have the most amount of errors in the league, but at least they don't have the least amount of\\ndouble plays like the New York Yankees.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By: Lana Hebda\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.title.x = element_textbox_simple(halign = .5)\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t guessed it by now, I’m trying to decide between the Rangers and the Braves. The Braves are solid on the mound being one of the top teams with strikeouts and led the league with the most games won. They are also solid in the box, leading the league with over 307 home runs and on average with doubles and triples.\nEven though the Rangers were below average when it came to strikeouts, they were right there on average with the games they won. They were also second when it came to batting that games would still be exciting enough to watch. They would be more fun to watch on the field with only 57 errors they had last season and also making 143 double plays. Which is only 9 more double plays than the Braves and 28 less errors.\nSo it really comes down to personal preference with these two teams.\nWhen it comes down to it, I think being solid on the mound and dominating in the box makes for a pretty exciting game. I think I should be able to let the errors slide and be willing to give up a few double plays here and there. I’m also not one to hop on the bandwagon, so who knows maybe the Braves’ fielding game will be top tier next season."
